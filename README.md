# wlan-clip

(wireless) local area network clipboard

## Goals
- [ ] allow user to copy/paste links or files between devices AKA `clippy`
- [ ] short-lived storage (clean up after use or daily) AKA `ghosty`
- [ ] make available as service (systemd) AKA `coasty`
- [ ] self-hosted and only available on local network (not implemented or enforced in this repo)
