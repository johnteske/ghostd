# ghosty

temporary shared clipboard server and UI, intended for (W)LAN use

## Goals
- [ ] allow user to copy/paste text (and files?) between devices AKA `clippy`
- [ ] store minimal data and only temporarily AKA `ghosty`
- [ ] make lightweight and available as service (systemd) AKA `coasty`
- [ ] self-host and make available only on local network (not implemented or enforced in this repo)

## Usage
`cargo run`: starts a web server at localhost:4321
