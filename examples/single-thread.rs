//! 1. Nonblocking stdin, for purposes of this example, would require another thread
//! While this isn't particularly an issue in this example, it would add extraneous
//! code--and I may as well use a TcpListener so the example code looks more like
//! the end goal for clarity.
//!
//! 2. Timeout. At first I had thought about setting an Instant and adding an duration
//! for the expiration Instant, then would compare against Instant::now(). Reading the
//! documentation it looks like simple comparisons are supported, so only the max
//! lifetime duration and timestamp are needed.
//!
//! 3. Error handling. I wanted to add a guard to the error checking to ensure we were
//! only permitting expected errors. For the purposes of this example, any other error
//! panics.
